# Bank Management System in Python

To use this Bank Management System, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system.

You can download the source code for the program from the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/RadoJezzy/Finals_Advance_Py/blob/main/PYTHON_FInal/Bank_Mngmnt_Sys.py

To run the program, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the code. Then, run the following command:

Copy code
python Bank_Mngmnt_Sys.py
This will start the program and display the main menu. From there, you can select the different options to create, modify, or perform transactions on accounts. The program uses a file called accounts.data to store information about the accounts, so make sure you have write permission to the directory where the program is run.

The program also uses the os and pathlib libraries to manipulate files, and the pickle library to serialize and deserialize Python objects. These libraries are included with Python, so you don't need to install them separately.

If you have any questions or issues with the program, please open an issue on the GitHub repository or contact the author for assistance.
